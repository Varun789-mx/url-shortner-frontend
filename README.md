## 🔑 Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the following:

```env
# The base URL of your backend API
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

> **Why `VITE_` prefix?** Vite only exposes environment variables that start with `VITE_` to the browser for security. Any variable without this prefix stays server-side only.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

Run these from the project root:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the local development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and bundles the app for production (outputs to `dist/`) |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Here's the full user journey from start to finish:

```
User pastes a long URL
        ↓
Form validates the input (is it actually a URL?)
        ↓
App sends POST api/create to the backend API
        ↓
Backend returns a short URL
        ↓
App displays the short URL with a Copy button
```

**Under the hood:**
- React `useState` tracks the input value, the returned short URL, and loading/error states
- A `fetch` (or `axios`) call hits your backend's `/shorten` endpoint
- While waiting for the response, a loading indicator is shown
- If something goes wrong, an error message is displayed instead
